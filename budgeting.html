        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          "Budgeting" is the process of creating a plan for how much money
          you'll spend. This spending plan, called a "budget", allocates a
          certain amount of your money for personal use. When budgeting, you
          should consider both your revenue and expenses to create a budget that
          doesn't bring you into debt.

        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>Why should you have a budget?</p>
        <p>
          For starters, a budget can help you spend within your limit. If you
          know how much money you make and spend in any given time period, you
          can use that knowledge to help you spend within your limits.
          Overspending is a dangerous habit as it can drive you into a sea of
          debt; budgets can help you avoid that.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, making a budget can reveal your spending habits. As you
          create your budget, you'll come face to face with how you spend your
          money, and if you're spending it on what truly matters (or not.) For
          example, you may find that you always pay your credit card bills in
          time and don't owe any late fees. Or you might find that your
          subscriptions are costing you more than you thought they did. In any
          case, budgeting allows you to see how healthy your spending habits
          are, and may be the first step in changing any habits that are
          obstructing your long-term financial goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          On that note, a budget is essential in maintaining your financial
          wellness in the long run. The process of budgeting itself forces you
          to think about both the money you make and how you spend that money,
          allowing you to determine what changes you'll need to make to improve
          your financial situation. When you finish, you can look over your
          budget and figure out how long it'll take you to achieve your
          financial goals - to get that car you really want, buy your first
          home, or maybe go on that vacation you thought you'd never be able to
          afford. Your budget can cast light on what you truly want from life
          and how much money you'll need to get to the places you want to go.

        <h2>How To Budget Effectively</h2>
        <p>
          Want to create a realistic spending plan, but aren't sure where to
          start? Here are some pointers that will help you budget effectively
          and painlessly.
        </p>
        <div class="step-1 rectangle">
          <h3>Step #1: Identify your revenues and expenses</h3>
          <p>
            This is how you begin creating your budget. First, decide on a time
            period for your budget. This could be anywhere from a month to a
            year, though we recommend 2-3 months, especially for beginners.
            Next, identify all sources of revenue - that is, the money you make.
            This includes your salary and any interest you earn. Add these
            accounts together to figure out how much money you put on the table
            in the time period you chose. Now you can move on to your expenses.
            This means any money you spend in your chosen time period, not
            including any one-time emergencies (such as car repairs.) Add these
            accounts together as well. Look over your revenue and expense totals
            and ask yourself: Am I spending more money than I'm making? How can
            I increase my revenue, or lower my expenses? Do I have enough money
            for emergencies? Keep these questions in mind as you continue with
            your budgeting process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-2 rectangle">
          <h3>Step #2: Separate your needs and wants</h3>
          <p>
            Your expense accounts can be further divided into two main
            categories - your needs and your wants. Your needs include things
            like rent, groceries, transportation, and medicine - anything you
            can't live without. Your wants, on the other hand, are things you'd
            like to have but don't need to survive, such as eating out,
            streaming services, or the latest tech. Separating your expenses
            into your needs and wants can help you figure out if you're wasting,
            rather than spending, your money on luxuries you don't need. Ask
            yourself: could you go without a music subscription or expensive new
            clothing for a while? Spending money on your wants is important, of
            course - it can relieve stress, boost creativity, and is a form of
            self-care - but overspending on these luxuries is dangerous, and you
            may find it in your best interest to save or invest that money
            instead. Try finding ways to have fun without spending as much money
            - for example, a movie night at your friend's house instead of going
            to the theatres.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-3 rectangle">
          <h3>Step #3: Set financial goals for yourself.</h3>
          <p>
            Now that you know how much money you make, how much money you spend,
            and what you spend your money on, you can start creating financial
            goals for your future self. Financial goals can be as simple as
            saving for retirement or as ambitious as starting a new business. If
            you love travelling, maybe you'll want to save enough money to fly
            overseas; if you have a family, then you'll need to start funding
            for your child's education. No matter what financial goals you have
            in mind, you must ensure that your goals are realistic. Unrealistic
            goals only set you up for disappointment, and can cause you to feel
            financially demotivated. Make sure the goals you set are something
            you can actually achieve by planning every step along the way.
