        <h2>Why Should You Learn About Finance?</h2>
        <p class="intro">
          Learning about financial matters such as budgeting, saving, investing,
          and managing debt all contribute to your financial literacy. Financial
          literacy refers to your understanding and application of various
          financial skills, and can benefit you in a number of ways throughout
          your life.
        </p>
        <div class="reasons">
          <div class="reason1">
            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              Being financially literate means you can make smarter decisions
              about your wealth, such as realistic saving goals, wiser
              investments, and effective debt prevention strategies. Being able
              to do these things yourself means you are less dependent on other
              people when it comes to your own money, boosting your
              self-sufficiency and financial freedom. Understanding financial
              principles and their importance are the first steps in attaining
              financial independence.
            </p>

            <h3>Security</h3>
            <img

            />
            <p>
              Knowing how to manage your money means you can secure your
              financial health and protect yourself from debt. People who are
              financially literate are less likely to make ruinous financial
              mistakes or go into debt, because they understand how they must
              manage their money for the best long-term gain. Improving your
              financial literacy can protect everything you've worked so hard
              for.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="reason3">
            <h3>Confidence</h3>
            <img
              src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/05/05/02/35/sky-1373167_1280.jpg"
            />
            <p>
              Financial literacy can impact who you are as a person as well as
              your wealth. Being able to manage your financial situation no
              matter how bad or good it gets can boost your morale, reduce your
              stress levels, and help you feel better about yourself and the way
              you've been handling things. This, in turn, can improve your
              confidence and self-esteem, allowing you to pursue your goals with
              greater enthusiasm.

            <p>
              The inspiration for this project came from seeing the financial
              struggles of those around me. When I say “financial struggles,” I
              don't mean not having enough money at home - I mean struggles to
              <i>understand</i> finance, from its most basic principles to the
              more complex ones. I hear a lot of kids my age, even the smart
              ones, talk about the financial aspect of adulthood with dread; not
              excited or determined but fearful of managing their own financial
              situation because of how unprepared they are.
            </p>
            <p>
              The root of their unpreparedness comes not from a lack of
              experience, but how hard it is to learn about finance even in
              theory, because financial resources such as articles, textbooks,
              and videos, all share one tragic flaw - assuming their reader is
              already financially literate. So many resources assume their users
              have a basic financial knowledge that most people, particularly
              the young, haven't acquired yet. This makes all the jargon,
              figures of speech, and abstractions composing these external
              resources indecipherable to those just starting to learn. Where
              were the basics - a place where people could start from?
            </p>
            <p>
              The desire for such a starting point to exist for my generation is
              what inspired me to create my project. The first step to becoming
              financially literate is the largest, and I wanted to create
              something that could help users take this step, and start them off
              on their journey to financial literacy. This “something” took form
              as an article-based, nonprofit website, both coded and written
              with simplicity in mind, to help the inexperienced take their
              first step. Appropriately named: First Step Finance.
